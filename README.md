# Snake-AI
In this repository you will see an agent playing the Snake game using a algorithm called Deep Q-learning.

The whole code was made from the tutorial of freeCodeCamp: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8ypSXwyBds

You need to have the four python files in the same folder and import it to Visual Studio Code or another code editor.

Note: You need to go to the current folder where the four files are and enter to it with your terminal.

There are some protips if you dont know how to do it:

command 'cd' to enter to a directory or folder

command 'cd..' to get out of the current directory or folder

command 'cls' to clean the things that you have on the terminal

command 'python file_name.py' to run a python file(remember that 'file_name.py' is the agent.py in our case)

NOTE: The whole comments and variables, some functions name's, etc., are in catalan (the oficial language of Catolonia).
